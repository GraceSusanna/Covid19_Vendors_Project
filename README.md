# Mysql connection with Python
This project demonstrates a Python script that connects to a MySQL database using the `mysql-connector` package. The script retrieves, inserts, updates, and deletes records in a table called `effects`, making it easy to manage and analyze data. It also includes functions for adding new columns and updating existing ones in the database, showcasing basic CRUD operations and SQL integration within Python.
